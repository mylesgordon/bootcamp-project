# Running the Project

In order to run this project, npm or yarn can be used. npm will be used for examples.

Both the API and frontend need to be running for the full experience.

## API

To run the API, set your terminal's directory to the API folder and install dependencies.

`cd api`

`npm install`

Once installed, you can run with either npm or nodemon. Example below shows running with nodemon:

`npx nodemon index.js`

The API should now be running on `http://localhost:3002`!

## Frontend

To run the frontend, set your terminal's directory to the frontend folder and install dependencies.

`cd frontend`

`npm install`

Once dependencices are installed, just run the following command and our project should launch on your browser!

`npm start`
